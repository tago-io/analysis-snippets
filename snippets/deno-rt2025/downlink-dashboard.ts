// @title: Downlink from Dashboard
// @description: Send downlink messages to devices triggered from dashboard
// @tags: downlink, dashboard, device, communication, control

/*
 ** Analysis Example
 ** Sending downlink using dashboard
 **
 ** Using an Input Widget in the dashboard, you will be able to trigger a downlink to
 ** any LoraWaN network server.
 ** You can get the dashboard template to use here: https://admin.tago.io/template/5f514218d4555600278023c4
 ** IMPORTANT: Your device is required to send an Uplink before any downlink can be send.
 **
 ** Environment Variables
 ** In order to use this analysis, you must setup the Environment Variable table.
 **
 ** default_PORT: The default port to be used if not sent by the dashboard.
 ** device_id: The default device id to be used if not sent by the dashboard (OPTIONAL).
 ** payload: The default payload to be used if not sent by the dashboard (OPTIONAL).
 **
 ** How to use:
 ** To analysis works, you need to add a new policy in your account. Steps to add a new policy:
 ** 1 - Click the button "Add Policy" at this url: https://admin.tago.io/am;
 ** 2 - In the Target selector, with the field set as "ID", choose your Analysis in the list;
 ** 3 - Click the "Click to add a new permission" element and select "Device" with the rule "Access, Edit, Token Access" with the field as "Any";
 ** 4 - Click the "Click to add a new permission" element and select "Network" with the rule "Access" with the field as "Any";
