"""
Analysis Example
Operate data from devices

Read information from a variable generated by devices,
run a simple calculation in real-time, and create a new variable with the output.

Instructions
To run this analysis you need to add a device token to the environment variables,
To do that, go to your device, then token and copy your token.
Go the the analysis, then environment variables,
type device_token on key, and paste your token on value
